## [Unreleased][new]

### Added
- Add a function to initialize weights and biases for all layers of the neural
  network.
- Add `linear_forward()`to compute the linear part of forward propagation for a
  given layer.
- Add `layer_forward()` to compute forward propagation through a single layer.
- Add `sigmoid()` and `relu()` activation functions.
- Add `model_forward()` to compute forward propagation for the complete model
  comprising (L-1) ReLU units followed by a single, sigmoid unit.
- Add `compute_cost()` to calculate the cross-entropy cost from the model
  predictions.
